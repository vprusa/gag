# MPU6050 & MPU9250 library combination for semi-parallel use of multiple MPU6050 & MPU9250 sensors on 1 device

[Official lib](https://github.com/jrowberg/i2cdevlib/blob/master/Arduino/MPU6050/) and its forks were used to make this work.
This should consume les memory then including libraries separatelly and solve issue with using just MPU9250 / MPU9150 to control MPU6050 & MPU9250
